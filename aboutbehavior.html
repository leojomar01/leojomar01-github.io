                <h3>Cat Body Language</h3>
                <br>
                <img class="img-thumbnail rightimg" src="images/health/bodylang3.jpg" alt="">

                <dd>One of the best things you can do to strengthen your relationship with your cat is to understand their body language. People communicate mainly in writing or speaking while cats use their body and sense of smell and touch.  By understanding their language, we can improve our relationship with them and interpret relationships between cats within our home.  </dd>
                <dd>By observing your cat, you will see differences in body language by the positions of their body, tail, ears and eyes. The signals of all these body parts combine to give us a clear idea of what they are trying to say.  Sometimes fearful cat body language, such as closing their eyes, hunching close to the ground and tucking their tail around them, may be an indication of pain. You should discuss any signs of anxiety, stress, or pain with your veterinarian.</dd>
                <dt>Body Position</dt>
                <br>
                <p>Examples of relaxed body language:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loose, stretching out on side</li>
                    <li>Rolling on back comfortably</li>
                    <li>Eyes blinking slowly, casually gazing or closed if sleeping</li>
                    <li>Ears in a neutral position or forward if alert/attentive</li>
                    <li>Tail in neutral relaxed position, tip might move slightly or upright in a question mark shape</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples of fearful body language:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tense</li>
                    <li>Hunching to ground, trying to hide</li>
                    <li>Eyes dilated in a light room or averted stare</li>
                    <li>Closed eyes but faking sleep may indicate pain/stress</li>
                    <li>Ears rotating backward or partially outward</li>
                    <li>Tail curled around or under body</li>

                <p>Examples of increased fear with possible aggressive body language:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eyes in a fixed stare</li>
                    <li>Ears flattened to either side</li>
                    <li>Tail twitching, lashing, or tail hairs standing on end</li>
                    <li>Arched back with tail hair standing on end, possibly dilated pupils and pinned-back ears (“Halloween cat”)</li>

                <h3>8 Interesting Cat Facts For All Cat Lovers</h3>
                <br>
                <img class="rightimg img-thumbnail" src="images/health/kitty.avif" alt="">
                <dt>Here, Kitty Kitty</dt>
                <dd>Cats respond most readily to names that end in an “ee” sound, which naturally is vocalized in a higher intonation. “A study was done several years ago to show that cats respond to their name much better if the name terminates in a high-pitched sound,” explains veterinarian Dr. Burstyn of Vancouver, BC. “For example, Lancelot ends on a low sound. He’s much less likely to respond [to] that than if we call him Lancey.”</dd>
                <br><br>
                <dt>Evol-eww-tion</dt>
                <dd>Due to their desert origins, cats evolved to absorb large amounts of water from their urine to stay hydrated. The result? Extra concentrated, extra smelly cat pee</dd>
                <br><br>
                <dt>Cranium Collab</dt>
                <img class="rightimg img-thumbnail" src="images/health/collab.avif" alt="">
                <dd>Ever feel like you and your cat are two of a kind? Research shows that humans and cats share a similar brain structure. The way we process memories, emotions, and the five senses are shared with our feline companions, according to Nicholas Dodman, BVMS, MRCVS, animal behavior chief at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine in Boston. </dd>
                <br><br><br><br><br>
                <dt>Eye See You</dt>
                <dd>Though they have an acute sense of sight and can see exceptionally well in complete darkness—approximately six to 10 times better than humans can—cats have a blind spot under their nose. They cannot see objects well that are directly in front of them, or under their nose or chins. They also perceive motion better than colour. Cats see mostly blues, purples, and greens, perceiving reddish tones less clearly.</dd>
                <br><br>
                <dt>Cats + Boxes, a Love Affair</dt>
                <dd>Is your cat stressed? Give him a box to hide in. Animal experts believe that small, enclosed spaces make cats feel secure and protected. Shelter cats are sometimes given boxes to snuggle in to reduce their stress levels with good reason. A Dutch study divided 14 shelter-intake cats into two groups—those provided with a hiding box and those without. By measuring the cats’ Kessler and Turner Cat-Stress-Score (CSS), the study determined that cats provided with a box were able to recover faster in their new environment. The researchers determined the hiding box was an important enrichment for the cats to cope effectively with stressors in a new shelter environment in the first weeks after their arrival.</dd>

                <dt>I’ll Take A Dozen!</dt>
                <dd>A group of kittens is called a kindle, while a group of fully-grown cats is called a clowder.</dd>
                <br><br>
                <dt>Not Just Southpaws</dt>
                <dd>Male cats are more likely to be left-pawed, while females are more likely to be right-pawed. 11 percent of cats are ambidextrous.</dd>

                <dt id="md">Cat, M.D.</dt>
                <dd>According to professors at the School of Veterinary Medicine in UCLA, investigators have found that the sound frequency of purring can “improve bone density and promote healing” in humans and cats. </dd>
